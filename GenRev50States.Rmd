```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```


1. Loading packages and reading data file.
```{r load packages, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
x <- c("ggmap", "rgdal", "rgeos", "maptools", "dplyr", "tidyr", "tmap","knitr")
#install.packages(x) 
lapply(x, library, character.only = TRUE) # load the required packages



Maps_PCJun2018 <- read.csv("Maps_PCJun2018.csv")


```

2. Loading U.S. County Shapefiles

```{r shapefiles}

library(rgdal)
USCounties <- readOGR(".","cb_2017_us_county_500k")
USCounties

nrow(USCounties)
ncol(USCounties)

head(USCounties@data)

#To check classes of all vars in spatial dataset
sapply(USCounties@data, class)
#It says all are of class factor.  
#To coerce them into numeric format so calculations like "mean"" work
USCounties$STATEFP <- as.numeric(as.character(USCounties$STATEFP))



```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
